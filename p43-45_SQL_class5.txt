select FirstName + ' ' + LastName from employee

select FirstName + ' ' + LastName  from employee

--CLASS-6
--LIKE 
--LIKE operator is used to search for a specified pattern in a column.
--Mostly like operator is used in where clause.
--Like operator used wildcards for searching a pattern
--1. % - Represents zero,one or multiple charecters or numbers./ A substitue for Zero or more characters
--2. _ - Represents one or single charecters./A A substitue for exactly one character.
--3.[Charlist] - Any single charecter in charlist ex: [ABC]
--4.[^Charlist] -any charecter not in charlist

--ex:  Seeta,meeta,geeta sena, sona siya 

--'S%' - start with 'S' chareter and it will display all the names which starts with S.
--'%S' - End with 'S' charetcer and it will display all the names which END with S.
--'%S%' -Anywhere inside record/column if 'S' charetcer and it will display all the names which starts or ends or anywhere inside into a column.

select * from employee where FirstName like 's%' ---at the start of name s

select * from employee where FirstName like '%A' -- at the end of name a

select * from employee where FirstName like '%A%' --anywhere inside or start or end.

--Display the name whose third letter starts with r
select * from employee where FirstName like '__r%' --Kirti,Virat

--Display the name which starts with s and ends with A
select * from employee where FirstName like 's%a' 

--Q.How will find the number of tables are present in database?
--By using Information_schema we can find the number of tables 
select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.tables --Number of tables present in data base

select * from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.tables where TABLE_NAME like 'emp%'  -- by using some pattern which you are aware about.

select * from employee where FirstName like '[ARV]%' -- it will display the names which start with A,R and V.

select * from employee where FirstName like '[^ARV]%' -- it will display the name which not start with A,R and V.

select * from employee where FirstName like '%[ARV]'

select * from employee where firstname like '[A-E]%' -- it will diplay all the names which is in range of A to E 

select * from employee where firstname like '[A-O]%'

--2.order by
--This clause is used to sort the result in ascending (ASC) or Descending(DESC) order.
--If the column contains NULL value in it and if we are performing order by operation then NULL value should be first in ASC and Last in DESC.

select * from employee order by salary -- this is by default ascending order

select * from employee order by salary ASC

select * from employee order by salary desc

select * from employee order by LastName desc
select * from employee order by LastName 
insert into employee values(11,'Meena','','Hyderabad','HR','')

insert into employee (EID,FirstName,LOc) values(12,'Roshan','Yavatmal')



select * from employee order by FirstName asc

--CLASS-7
--NULL Values 
--A column with a NULL value is column with NO value
--NULL valu is diffrent from 0(zero) and blank/empty sapce.

select * from employee where salary = NULL

--Q.How to test the NULL values from column?
--There are two ways to check the NULL values from column
--1.IS NULL
--2.IS NOT NULL

select * from employee where salary = NULL  -- Blank /not possible to check by using comaprision/logical/arithmatic opeartor 
select * from employee where salary is NULL 

select * from employee where salary is not NULL 


--2.DML(Data Manipulation Language) -- S_UID
--UPDATE
--Update statement is used to update complete column data or specific record if condition is provided.
-- By using update statement you can only play with table data.

--synatx:
--UPDATE TABLE_NAME SET COLUMN_NAME ='VALUE' where COLUMN_NAME ='CONDITION'



create table UPDATE_DELETE (U_ID int, UNAME varchar(20) ,ULOC varchar(20))

update UPDATE_DELETE SET ULOC ='Pune' where U_ID >=2

update UPDATE_DELETE SET ULOC ='Jaipur' where U_ID =5

update UPDATE_DELETE SET UNAME ='Sohan' where U_ID =4

--DELETE
--Delete statement is used to delete the data from table row by row.
--By using DELETE statement it is not possible to delete the structure.
--We can delete the table data at one time or row by row by specifying an condition.

--syntax:
--DELETE TABLE_NAME where COULMN_NAME ='CONDITION'

select * from UPDATE_DELETE

delete UPDATE_DELETE -- it will delete the complete data from table.

delete UPDATE_DELETE where U_ID =5

delete UPDATE_DELETE where U_ID <=2

--1.Data Defination Language(DDL) - 
--Along with DDL statements "TABLE" Keyword is mandotory.
--DROP
--DROP statement will delete the table structure as well as table data.
--Drop statement we can drop or delete the database.

--syntax:
--DROP TABLE TABLE_NAME 
--DROP DATABASE DATABASE_NAME

DROP table UPDATE_DELETE -- it will delete table data as well as table structutre.

--Q.Diffrence between Delete and Drop?


select * from employee where firstname like '%[_]%'
select * from employee where FIRSTname like '%#_%'escape'#'
--'%[rt]'

--Truncate 
--Truncate statement allow you to delete the records from a table at once.
--It wont delete the structure of the table
--In Truncate you can't delete the data Row-By-Row by specifying a condtion.

--syntax : truncate table table_name 

create table Truncate1 (U_ID int, UNAME varchar(20) ,ULOC varchar(20))

insert into Truncate1 values (1,'Sagar','PUNE')
insert into Truncate1 values (2,'Amit','Sangli')
insert into Truncate1 values (3,'Sarika','Bijapur')
insert into Truncate1 values (4,'Rohan','Mumbai')
insert into Truncate1 values (5,'Amrita','Palampur')
